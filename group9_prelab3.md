1. Calculate the mass of sodium sulfite needed to reduce all the dissolved oxygen in $750 mL$ of pure water in equilibrium with the atmosphere at $22 \degree C$.

Based on the graph generated by the code given in the lab handout, at $22 \degree C$ the concentration of Oxygen in water is $8.894 mg/L$. Knowing that the volume of our sample is $750 mL$, we can find that the amount of Oxygen in water is
$$8.894 mg O_2/L*750mL*\frac{1L}{1000mL}=6.67mg O_2$$
Knowing that sulfite reduces dissolved oxygen with the following chemical reaction, we can calculate the mass of sodium sulfite required to deoxygenate the dissolved oxygen.
$$O_2+2SO_3^-^2 \rightarrow 2SO_4^-^2$$

$$6.67mg O_2*\frac{1mmol}{32mgO2}*\frac{2mmol Na_2SO_3}{1mmolO_2}*\frac{126 mg Na_2SO_3}{1mmol Na_2SO_3}=52.52mg$$
The code used to generate the initial $8.894 mg/L$ value is as follows:

```python
# pre-lab #3 code
import aguaclara.research.environmental_processes_analysis as epa
from aguaclara.core.units import unit_registry as u
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
def O2_sat(P_air, temp):
    """This equation returns saturated oxygen concentration in mg/L. It is
    valid for 278 K < T < 318 K

    """
    fraction_O2 = 0.21
    P_O2 = P_air * fraction_O2
    return ((P_O2.to(u.atm).magnitude) * u.mg/u.L*np.exp(1727 / temp.to(u.K).magnitude - 2.105))


P_air = 101.3*u.kPa
temp = np.linspace(0, 40)*u.degC
C_Oxygen = epa.O2_sat(P_air, temp)
print(epa.O2_sat(P_air, 22*u.degC))  # initial C_O2 when temperature is 22 C'''
```

2. Describe your expectations for dissolved oxygen concentrations as a function of time during a re-aeration experiment. Assume you have added enough sodium sulfite to consume all of the oxygen at the start of the experiment. What would the shape of the curve look like?

Since there is enough sodium sulfate to consume all of the oxygen at the start, the curve would begin at 0 and increase over time as oxygen is added to the system. The dissolved oxygen curve would increase exponentially from 0 and, without any other oxygen-consuming events, the dissolved oxygen concentration would eventually plateau to the equilibrium dissolved gas concentration (i.e., saturation concentration).

Why is $\hat k__l$ not zero when the gas flow rate (of the diffuser) is zero? How can oxygen transfer into the reactor even when no air is pumped into the diffuser?

Even if there is no air pumped into the reactor by a diffuser, oxygen from the atmosphere can diffuse across the surface area and thus the volumetric gas transfer coefficient will not be zero.

Describe your expectations for $\hat k_v_l$ as a function of gas flow rate. Do you expect a straight line? Why?

$\hat k_v_l$ is a function of various factors and thus coming up with a single equation that captures all will be very difficult since it is a complex system. Still, we can infer that as the gas flow rate increases, because the bubbles become more buoyant, the bubbles will rise and reach the surface faster. Therefore, the contact time between the water and the bubbles will decrease and less diffusion will occur. Thus, $\hat k_v_l$ as a function of gas flow rate will show an inverse relationship.

5. A dissolved oxygen probe was placed in a small vial in such a way that the vial was sealed. The water in the vial was sterile. Over a period of several hours, the dissolved oxygen concentration gradually decreased to zero. Why? (Consider how dissolved oxygen probes work!)

The dissolved oxygen probe works by transforming oxygen into $H_2O$ by applying a potential of $0.8 V$. The probe exists in a small cell with a gas-permeable membrane. Since the probe makes a cell with Oxygen concentration of 0, oxygen concentration is measured based on the rate at which oxygen diffuses into the cell.

In a small vial, the DO probe would over time have removed all Oxygen in the system because the small volume means that all oxygen would easily be removed by the probe.
